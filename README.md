CUDA Stream Compaction

## Questions:
- *Roughly optimize the block sizes of each of your implementations for minimal run time on your GPU.*

blocksize/ops' time(ms)|	naive scan(ms)|	efficient scan(ms)
-----|-----|----
128 |	1.911 |	0.541
256 |	1.908 |	0.533
512 |	1.92 |	0.545
1024 |	1.915 |	0.559

- the diagram bellow explicitly shows how variation of block size impact on both the naive and the optimized solutions for scanning, although it's not very apparent, I think block size == 256 is best suited for me, in terms of my own machine condition, algorithms, etc...

- *Compare all of these GPU Scan implementations (Naive, Work-Efficient, and Thrust) to the serial CPU version of Scan. Plot a graph of the comparison (with array size on the independent axis).*

Array Size(2^(n))/ops' time(ms)|	Na√Øve |	Work Efficient(optimized)|	Work Efficient(not optimized) |	Thrust
----|----|----|----|----
3	| 0.032 |	0.029 |	0.093 |	0.085
6	| 0.049	| 0.046	|0.058|	0.065
9	| 0.076	| 0.075	| 0.068	|0.249
12	| 0.09	| 0.137	| 0.135|	0.255
15	| 0.128	| 0.131 |	0.118|	0.263
18	| 0.306	| 0.471 |	0.167	|0.36
21	| 3.89	| 2.311	| 1.008	|0.37
24	| 35.408	| 19.495	|7.925|	0.932
27	| 317.784	| 141.549	|61.03|	5.704

## Results

### I got this result using the following settings:

- ```blocksize``` = 1024
- ```SIZE``` (in main.cpp) =  1 << 25
